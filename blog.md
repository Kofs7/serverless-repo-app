## About Me
What's good?
I am Yoofi and I am currently a rising junior majoring
in computer science at Howard University.
I mainly code in Python and hope to learn more about JavaScript
during this camp to help in my web dev journey.
I also hope yo get more internships through this and ultimately 
a job or even make a startup.
